            Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the
            existence of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so
            uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8
            billion years ago.Credit...

          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
          Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
          far beyond the world of known physics.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
          particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
          discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
          potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
          infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
          force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light
          for a prodigiously violent instant.
        </p>

        <p>
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
          heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
          mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
          irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted
          beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
          and drew a double box around it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="second-part">
        <article>
          <p>
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
            that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
            hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
            cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers
            led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
            Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
            so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
            wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
            trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
            smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
            colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

          </div>
          <p>
            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
            many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
          </p>
          <p>
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
            science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
            the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
            realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending
            14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of
            galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
            extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our
            own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
            bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling
            over.

          ‘As Big as It Gets’

          In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
          operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
          accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr.
          Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational
          waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity,
          should ruffle space-time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
          expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it
          gets.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
          sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath
          of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of
          the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface
          of the sun.

          Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
          Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
          reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
          Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
          Astrophysical Journal.

          The Theory of Inflation
        </div>
        <p>
          Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation,
          which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly
          in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

              <span>THE UNIVERSE </span>is just under 14 billion years old. From
              our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that
              is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery.
              Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.

              <span>NOT ENOUGH TIME </span>The universe is not old enough for
              light to have traveled the vast distance from one side of the
              universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for
              scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.

              <span>DISTANT COFFEE </span>At a smaller scale, imagine using a
              telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup,
              and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and
              how much it has cooled.

            <p>
              <span>COFFEE EVERYWHERE </span>Now turn around and look a mile in
              the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the
              same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup
              in every direction, you might want to look for another
              explanation.

              <span>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME </span>There has not been enough time
              to carry coffee cups from place to place before they get cold. But
              if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee
              pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even
              temperature.

            <p>
              <span>INFLATION </span>solves this problem. The theory proposes
              that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the
              universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in
              the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the
              large-scale structures of the universe.

              <span>FLUCTUATION </span>Astronomers have now detected evidence of
              these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the
              cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the
              early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by
              Einstein.

              <span>EXPANSION </span>Returning to our coffee, imagine a single,
              central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to an even
              temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And
              the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the
              original pot.
