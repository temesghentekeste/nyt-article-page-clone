            Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the
            existence of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so
            uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8
            billion years ago.Credit...

          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
          Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
          far beyond the world of known physics.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
          particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
          discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
          potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
          infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
          force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light
          for a prodigiously violent instant.
        </p>

        <p>
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
          heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
          mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
          irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted
          beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
          and drew a double box around it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="second-part">
        <article>
          <p>
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
            that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
            hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
            cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers
            led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
            Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
            so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
            wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
            trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
            smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
            colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

          </div>
          <p>
            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
            many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
          </p>
          <p>
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
            science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
            the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
            realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending
            14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of
            galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
            extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our
            own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
            bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling
            over.

          ‘As Big as It Gets’

          In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
          operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
          accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr.
          Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational
          waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity,
          should ruffle space-time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
          expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it
          gets.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
          sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath
          of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of
          the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface
          of the sun.

          Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
          Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
          reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
          Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
          Astrophysical Journal.

          The Theory of Inflation
        </div>
        <p>
          Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation,
          which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly
          in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

              <span>THE UNIVERSE </span>is just under 14 billion years old. From
              our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that
              is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery.
              Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.

              light to have traveled the vast distance from one side of the
              universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for
              scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.

              telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup,
              and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and
              how much it has cooled.

          <div>

              <span>COFFEE EVERYWHERE </span>Now turn around and look a mile in
              the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the
              same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup
              in every direction, you might want to look for another

              to carry coffee cups from place to place before they get cold. But
              if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee
              pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even

              <span>INFLATION </span>solves this problem. The theory proposes
              that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the
              universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in
              the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the
              large-scale structures of the universe.

          <div>
            <p>
              <span>FLUCTUATION </span>Astronomers have now detected evidence of
              these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the
              cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the
              early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by
              Einstein.

              central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to an even
              temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And
              the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the
              original pot.

          Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one
          in 10 million.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not
          expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>
          “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been
          lucky.”
        </p>

        <p>
          The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth
          of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr.
          Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting
          with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of
          Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in
          1979), in his office last week.
        </p>

        <p>
          “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as
          scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he
          tended his radio telescopes.

          Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the
          most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in
          1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when
          Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team,<a

          Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered
          anything.
        </p>

        <p>
          “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a
          delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply
          forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in
          an email.
        </p>
        <p>
          Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he
          was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of
          spoiling a vacation,” he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that
          inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded
          with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
        </p>

        <p>
          Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that
          if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries
          in the history of science.”
        </p>

        <p>
          John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and
          head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope,
          pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are
          beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
        </p>

        <p>
          Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation
          that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis,
          said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he
          expressed reservations about inflation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the
          need for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier
          estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the
          European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about
          the universe.
        </p>

        <p>
          “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr.
          Krauss said.
        </p>

        <p>
          Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will
          report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are
          trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.

          Spirals in the Sky
        </span>

        <p>
          Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the
          cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias
          and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these
          waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series
          of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where
          the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are
          Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the
          California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
        </p>

        <p>
          “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on
          the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said,
          wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

              The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the

              being wrenched violently apart at its birth.

        <p>
          In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave
          radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight
          preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
        </p>

        <p>
          This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the
          gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one
          direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the
          direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a
          result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows
          going in spirals.
        </p>

        <p>
          Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small
          differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s
          telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.
        </p>

        <p>
          “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.
        </p>

        <p>
          The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a
          year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had
          things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the
          breakthrough.
        </p>
        <h2>A Special Time</h2>
        <p>
          The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like
          Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago,
          suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity,
          electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have
          long suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a
          single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest
          moments.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall
          from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling
          out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after
          another splitting away.
        </p>
        <p>That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
        <p>
          Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the
          temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which
          point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state
          too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with a
          mysterious latent energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a
          kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it
          was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was
          created, the harder it pushed apart.
        </p>
        <p>
          What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least
          a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial
          energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary
          particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead,
          resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars
          billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such
          thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might
          be the ultimate free lunch.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting
          from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once started,
          is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable
          homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up,
          spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the
          multiverse.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not
          bother asking about going any deeper into the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very
          beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before it.
          All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away,
          forever out of our view.
        </p>
        <p>
          “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a
          Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team, “you wind
          up at inflation.”
